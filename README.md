# REST API with Node.js, Express, and CORS

This project is a simple REST API built with Node.js and Express. It demonstrates how to set up a server, define routes, and enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). We use Thunder Client to build and test our API endpoints.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm
- Thunder Client (VS Code extension)

### Installing

1. Clone the repository 
```
   git clone https://github.com/AndresDiagoM/rest-api-midudev
```
2. Install dependencies
```
   npm install
```
3. Start the server
```
   npm start
```


## Using the API

Once the server is running, you can use Thunder Client to send HTTP requests to the server. The base URL for all requests is `http://localhost:3000`.

### Endpoints

- `GET /endpoint`: Description of what this endpoint does
- `POST /endpoint`: Description of what this endpoint does
- `PUT /endpoint/:id`: Description of what this endpoint does
- `DELETE /endpoint/:id`: Description of what this endpoint does

## Built With

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Web application framework
- [CORS](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cors.html) - Middleware to enable CORS
